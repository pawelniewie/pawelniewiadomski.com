    <p>How I turned myself into an active person.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been a couch potato for thirty years. As a kid I played soccer, climbed trees, and did other usual stuff. Loved to ride a bike. But when I went to the high school much of that changed. Got addicted to computers and become a beast living in a dungeon ;-)</p>

<p>Since back then I rarely had some physical activity. Couple of years ago I biked to work. But my physical condition wasn&#8217;t the best. More intensive activity left me tired and I recovered slowly.</p>

<p>Usually if I was pedaling fast I was laying on the couch for an hour to recover. And by fast I don&#8217;t mean speed of light. I was overtaken by other folks riding.</p>

<p>So, you get the picture. I was also almost 20 kilos over my weight, I weighted 85&#160;kg with 173&#160;cm of height, back in high school it was 70&#160;kg tops.</p>

<p>Year and a half ago I decided to do something with my life and become more active - I started running, went to a gym three times a week and did my way into fitness lifestyle. I was still tired, but at least I was improving.</p>

<p>Imagine that it went well for couple of months. But then I had a breakdown. Fast forward six months of a disease that left me barely walking. I was diagnosed with a celiac disease.</p>

<p>Now, keeping a diet I&#8217;m recovering. Still I got a sick gut but I&#8217;m doing reasonably ok.</p>

<p>What changed is that for last two months I&#8217;ve been riding to work on my bicycle almost every day. I started running, it&#8217;s not a problem for me to be active. I don&#8217;t feel exhausted. I recover a lot faster. I gain muscle tissue. I play squash.</p>

<p>If I were two years ago told that I would be that active I would not believe it and I would not sustain it back then.</p>

<p>When I investigated my disease I learned that you and me are capable of great things and our bodies are meant to be moved. </p>

<p>But if something stops you. If you feel that you don&#8217;t have any strength to move and if a thought about physical activity make you tired already go a consult a doctor or do a simple test - stay away from flour, bread, pasta, and anything else that contains gluten for a month.</p>

<p>See if that helps. You may be surprised what results you will achieve. Not only you may get better psychically but you mind we&#8217;ll be better. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never had so much energy, positive thoughts and good spirit before I&#8217;ve resigned from gluten.</p>

<p>And believe me - staying without gluten is easier than it sounds - just get rid of anything it contains from home. Then buy only what&#8217;s safe. Eat a lot of vegetables, fruits and meat (any kind), rice, corn, buckwheat.</p>
