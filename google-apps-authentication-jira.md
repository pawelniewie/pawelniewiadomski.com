OpenID Authentication for JIRA
=============

Hi,
I'm really happy that you are evaluating [OpenID Authentication](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.pawelniewiadomski.jira.jira-openid-authentication-plugin)

You clicked the documentation link and I wonder what would you want to find here.

I tried to make this plugin self-explanatory but if I failed in that and you have any doubts or questions please [contact me](mailto:pawelniewiadomski@me.com) so I can answer them and also improve the plugin.

Cheers,
Pawel
