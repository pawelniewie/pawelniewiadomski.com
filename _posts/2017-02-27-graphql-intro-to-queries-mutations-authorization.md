I'm working on an app that relies heavily on GraphQL. Here's the talk I gave recently on [TRUG](http://trug.pl) about my experience so far.

I know many of you speak Polish so I'm publishing it on my blog as well. Sorry if you're not. Time to learn maybe? ;-)

In summary I'm talking about:

* building schema with queries
* pagination
* handling client requested ordering
* authorization with pundit
* multi-tenancy support
* adding mutations
* returning either from mutations (success or validation errors)
