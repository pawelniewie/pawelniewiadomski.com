This weekend I installed OS X Server which I have free as part of Mac Developer program.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never used it before and I was really curious about Apple Wiki that&#8217;s built into it.</p>
<p>I love how they covered all Unix services by one app, everything is already integrated, there&#8217;s LDAP, and plenty of other useful things. No need to play around with configuration files.</p>
<p>Turning Wiki on is a matter of clicking a button. Wish <a href="http://atlassian.com/confluence" target="_blank">Confluence</a> was that simple to set up.</p>
<p>After you click the button you need to wait for a minute or two and you&#8217;re done!</p>
<p>You have basically everything you need - which is a simple WYSIWYG editor that supports tables, a few text styles, attachments, inline images.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also an activity stream for each user, tags for posts, some search. Everything packed into minimalistic Apple UI. As I would see a cheaper, simpler and uglier Confluence ;-)</p>
<p>There are no built in plugins, macros and anything like that. I&#8217;m guessing part of it is written in Ruby, but I haven&#8217;t found any details about it. I wonder whether they will ever allow external plugins.</p>
<p>Confluence strength comes from a great look and feel, UX, ability to support many custom settings but also from a great pool of external plugins.</p>
<p>If they want to grow this product they should. But it may not be an Apple way to do that. It doesn&#8217;t seem they invested a lot into this application. I&#8217;m really curious what will happen to it in the future.</p>
