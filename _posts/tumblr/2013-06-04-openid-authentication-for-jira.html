<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_mnvzmoRWs81s8nah1o1_1280.png"/><br/><p>Here&#8217;s my new upcoming plugin for Atlassian JIRA that will let you to set up JIRA to accept OpenID authentication.</p>
<p>It will match users by email, and if the user doesn&#8217;t exist and JIRA is in public mode and uses internal user directory it will automatically create an account for the user and log him in.</p>
<p>No further configuration needed. You just install it, provide the license, and you&#8217;ll get nice buttons on the Log in page.</p>
<p>Currently supports Google and Yahoo. Soon to follow. Especially the custom OpenID server will be available next.Â </p>
