<p>I work 8 hours a day, I have a family life (wife + 2 kids), I try to get fit so I&#8217;m going to gym 3 times a week for an hour, 3 other days I try to run for 15-30 minutes. In spare time I try to educate myself, keep up with blogs, share posts on this blog and on <a href="http://paleomenu.pl">the other</a>.</p>
<p>And I also recently published <a href="http://pawelniewiadomski.pl/2013/05/26/new-queued-version-is-available-for-download.html">Queued</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.pawelniewiadomski.jira.jira-openid-authentication-plugin">OpenID plugin for JIRA</a>, new version of <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.pawelniewiadomski.devs.jira.automat">Automat plugin for JIRA</a>.</p>
<p>I understand how hard it is to get some spare time to work on you next big thing. But when you get it don&#8217;t waste it. Here&#8217;s how I do it.</p>
<p>I have a loving and supportive wife that knows my character flaws and helps me charge batteries when I&#8217;m out of energy (I&#8217;m an introvert so I need some rest from time to time).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a control freak - I try to delegate as much as I can, even if results may vary. It&#8217;s sometimes better to let it go and iterate on a solution than to have it done on the first try.</p>
<p>I keep a <a href="http://pawelniewiadomski.pl/2013/05/06/how-diary-help-me-notice-my-progress.html">diary</a> that helps me defragment my brain. I keep a sparkle file that I note my ideas in. So I don&#8217;t have to remember about anything.</p>
<p>I follow GTD but I&#8217;m not best at it. I write down things I need to do, but sometimes forget to refer to the list ;-) But it&#8217;s ok.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the most important is that on my GTD list I keep next simplest task that I can do in a project. So I really can do something even if I have half an hour. I don&#8217;t have to think about it when I have the time.</p>
<p>I love music so I try to listen to it with kids - it&#8217;s fun for them and joy for me. If you saw us dancing ;-)</p>
<p>I listen to audiobooks on my ride to work. </p>
<p>I try to waste some time (yup, exactly). What I found is that when I&#8217;m sitting alone for a while I get best ideas. So I try to do it from time to time. Unfortunately it&#8217;s not that often. My dream is to have at least an hour a day for this. I could improve my work so much!</p>
<p>I eat healthy so I don&#8217;t have any gastric problems and my energy levels are fine. Which means I don&#8217;t have hours when I feel sluggish, or wasted. I recycle faster.</p>
<p>I understand how little time I have so I&#8217;m not too ambitious and I don&#8217;t get upset because of how little I did in a week. I just look forward for opportunities and time. This makes me look forward, rather backward on what is to do.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t have social life, I&#8217;m an introvert I don&#8217;t need much, riding on a bus gives me enough social stimulation for a day ;-)</p>
<p>To be honest, from this list you can see that I&#8217;m probably not so different from you. So you don&#8217;t have to wait for some special time to start a project. You can start now and you will eventually end up with something - tiny steps will take you there. </p>
