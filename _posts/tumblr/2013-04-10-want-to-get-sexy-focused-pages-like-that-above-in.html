<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_ml1dg3UlUY1s8nah1o1_1280.png"/><br/><p>Want to get sexy, focused pages like that above in JIRA 6.0?</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/design/layout.html" target="_blank">the new focused task page</a> layout introduced by ADG.</p>
<p>But remember to add some little magic to your page (if you&#8217;re using it in the Administration section):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;meta name=&#8221;decorator&#8221; content=&#8221;panel-admin&#8221;/&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Otherwise you&#8217;ll end up with a slightly broken focused page that will include Â Administration&#8217;s menu.</p>
