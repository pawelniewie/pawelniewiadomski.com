<p>Your job as a software developer doesn&#8217;t end when you&#8217;ve coded the solution, it ends when you&#8217;ve build a system which solves the customer problem. Preferably without client noticing the cogs inside.</p>
<p>This means you&#8217;re responsible for the whole thing - coding, documentation, customer support, but mostly focusing on the client.</p>
