<p>I&#8217;m an aspiring entrepreneur. Yet, I own no company and all my business attempts failed. I&#8217;m not even a freelancer. I go to a regular job. I rarely have ground shaking ideas. I&#8217;m a failure.</p>

<p>But that worries me not. I used to think that I failed, used to think I was stupid because I tried. I lost so many money. I&#8217;ve spent so much time building things that didn&#8217;t take off.</p>

<p>Yet, I&#8217;m still happy and proud of what I achieved. Because I&#8217;ve moved step closer to my destination. I tried and I failed, which is more than no trying at all. I learned so many things.</p>

<p>I now know so many things no to do. I&#8217;m getting closer each time I fail. I realized that it doesn&#8217;t take you a month, or a year to become successful. I was eager and impatient. Now I learned not to be.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m here for the long run. Each month I move a bit closer. I learn new things. I try new things. It will take me a year, or a few to move significantly. But I&#8217;m here for the long run.</p>

<p>I will be successful - not this year, than another. I know it. I see it.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry you haven&#8217;t made a progress yet, if you focused, you&#8217;ll get there!</p>
