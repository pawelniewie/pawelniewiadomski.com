<p><a class="external-link" href="http://sivers.org/" rel="nofollow">Derek Sivers</a>, one of the absolutely phenomenal people I know is looking for help. He&#8217;s really one of the kind - passionate, funny, charming, and open. He&#8217;s been running a very successful and inspirational blog for years. I&#8217;d love to help him.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s currently preparing a series of books about running a business in Asia. His done a first edition already, but he wants to expand. I think this is a great opportunity for working on something great and helpful and meet great people.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s couple of opportunities like researcher, writer or even business manager. This is usually ground work - meeting people, researching, connecting, etc. Short-time gig. But interesting for sure.</p>
<p>If you know anyone who would be interested please let them know - you can find more details at <a class="external-link" href="http://woodegg.com/help" rel="nofollow">http://woodegg.com/help</a> (maybe a spouse, sister, or a colleague of yours will be interested?)</p>
