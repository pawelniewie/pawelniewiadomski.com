<p>You&#8217;re thinking about a product that could be useful, bring you money or fame. But you don&#8217;t seem to progress. The damn thing is left unfinished on your drive or in the garage. If you don&#8217;t want your project to succeed here&#8217;s couple of good ways to kill it:</p>
<ul><li>Don&#8217;t build a product you want to use (or want others to use)</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t do dogfooding</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t tell anyone about what you&#8217;re doing (especially in public)</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t set deadlines</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t talk to customers</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t look for people that could help</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t write it down (keep it in your head when it&#8217;s safest)</li>
</ul><p>I&#8217;m guilty as charged. I have this idea for a great Twitter/social networking client that I started, almost finished MVP but I keep postponing <a href="http://hoopoeapp.com" target="_blank">the damn thing</a>.</p>
<p>Because I use another application for Twitter I don&#8217;t have the urge to fix mine. If I deleted it I&#8217;d have a working version already.</p>
<p>I tried to look for a people to come and help with the project but I did it in so shitty way - after a few first &#8220;no&#8221; I decided to leave it.</p>
<p>And I could continue with the list. Please don&#8217;t follow into my steps.</p>
