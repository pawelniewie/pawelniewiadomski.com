<p>I&#8217;m in the process of founding my next start-up. I already have a history of failed attempts. This time I want to approach things differently and look for someone that would competent my deficiencies.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve been actively looking and talking to some people. I&#8217;ve found some interesting ideas, some people worth listening to. But I haven&#8217;t found a perfect match.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a couple of observations - there&#8217;s a lot of hoopla around startups - it&#8217;s the current fashion so everyone wants to try. There&#8217;s a lot of people with ideas, but a lot of them believes that creating a site is a matter of weeks (or even days) and it&#8217;s not a hard work. They seem to believe that you should first build the stuff and they will come.Â </p>

<p>So they don&#8217;t understand why would anyone try to verify the idea ASAP. Like - let&#8217;s build a web site and process orders manually first, what? Are you crazy? I want to have feature X, and feature Y, and this site needs to look great, and it must be super fast, AJAX and mobile. You go now, build it.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t found anyone yet that would tell me that the idea came from his observation or a specific need, or lack of existing solutions. Usually it&#8217;s like &#8220;I had a dream&#8221; now let&#8217;s build it :-) Customer development, customer what?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to get software developer buddies to be interested, if I&#8217;m talking to anyone they treasure their ideas. You want to join me? Great! You want me to join you? Sure, but first let me finish this, and that ;-) Or &#8220;sorry mate I&#8217;m so swamped&#8221;.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s not that tragic after all. What I found is that talking with different people gives me a new perspective. I collect observations, it&#8217;s nothing that I can execute on now, but it gives food for thought.</p>

<p>Also looking or not in the mean time I&#8217;m trying to keep myself busy doing some fun stuff - like working on a <a href="https://twitter.com/devonsteroids/status/323545115392102400">Buffer Mac helper</a>, or dreaming about a new better Twitter client with focus on lists, RSS like experience, and multi columns (TweetDeck style).</p>

<p>Because I love building software, and I want to learn new things.</p>
