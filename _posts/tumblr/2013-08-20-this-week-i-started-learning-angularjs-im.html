I&#8217;m working on a pet project in spare time - a simple Facebook integration that basically lets you associate users with different interests and find matches. Really it&#8217;s nothing big, just a trivial way to explore Facebook API and AngularJS.</p>
<p>I would not call myself a front end developer but I did some JavaScript. JIRA is JavaScript intense so everyone has to know his way around.</p>
<p>My JavaScript adventure started with Yahoo UI a few years ago when we were doing our startup. It was too heavy and now I understand that it was a mistake to use it in the first place. But jQuery back then seemed too hackish/poor (I didn&#8217;t appreciate it simplicify).</p>
<p>Later I learned jQuery, then Backbone which JIRA currently utilizes.</p>
<p>In the meantime I goofed around with GWT, we all did ;-)</p>
<p>I thought Backbone was good. I really enjoyed the approach, separation.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s be honest writing something complex was pain in the ass. Like in Java - a lot of boiler plate to get to the real stuff.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m amazed with AngularJS approach. I really love how they managed to separate HTML from JavaScript, yet they managed to make it so easy to combine both.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like you&#8217;d be writing your code is some cool server side rendered template engine.</p>
<p>The only PITA is documentation, or lack thereof. There&#8217;s a nice tutorial, but nothing that would showcase the usual use cases. Fortunately the community is strong and google will let you find nice examples.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t checked it out yet I strongly advice you take a look.</p>
