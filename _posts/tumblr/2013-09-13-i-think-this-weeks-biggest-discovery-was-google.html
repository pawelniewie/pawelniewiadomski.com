I always used Google Keywords and didn&#8217;t know there&#8217;s something different. Coming from Google I think I assumed it&#8217;s the only thing.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&#8217;s because everyone talks about Google Keywords and doesn&#8217;t mention Trends, not sure, but lucky I finally discovered it. It&#8217;s great analyzing where your market is going, what are the current trends and what&#8217;s already fading.</p>
