<p>I could not agree more. Especially the second part, in current busy times one would be temped to do multitasking while eating. But usually it&#8217;s no good. You stuff the food into you rapidly and you treat it as another task - just eat and be done with it.</p>
<p>I enjoy taking a break at work to eat because I relax and rest then. I sit next to a window and not only I enjoy the food, but also the outside view. I gives me such a needed break and time to escape with my thoughts.</p>
<p>And usually when you defocus from the work and enjoy other thoughts you end up working better afterwards. Those all eureka moments afterwards are a prize for relaxing.</p>
