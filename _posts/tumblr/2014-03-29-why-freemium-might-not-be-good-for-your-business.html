<p>In short because if you start a business the one of the most important things you need to do is to validate the idea.</p>
<p>Why spend time building something that actually no one values?</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s the best way to see if people value the service?</p>
<p>Of course it is to ask them to give you the money.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not only about that - I&#8217;ve recently were talking with one of the friends using TeamStatus. We were talking about pricing too and he gave a number which he could pay for the service.</p>
<p>So I asked him to actually gave me the money and then we both realized some other constraints involved. Like he&#8217;s a contractor and it was hard for him to ask for the money the company he was doing the work for.</p>
<p>So I know not to focus on contractors, at least now ;-)</p>
<p>The other thing is that if you want to have a bootstrapped company you need to have some cash flow ASAP.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re not going to currently introduce any free plans for TeamStatus but we will offer a free trial period because we want to make sure we do bring value to the team.</p>
<p>If we are not we don&#8217;t want your money!Â </p>
