<p>At Atlassian we don&#8217;t have testers. Each developer is a tester, we test each other tasks after they are implemented, that&#8217;s called DoTing (developer on tests).</p>
<p>I usually suck at this compared to other colleagues. A few of them have this attention to detail and perseverance that makes them great testers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fast paced, I get bored at repetitive tasks, I get distracted, and so on.</p>
<p>We have a QA guru on our team, but she&#8217;s in Sydney, 10 hours away. Her job is not to test our stuff but to teach us, point out things to keep in mind when testing and so on.</p>
<p>Some time ago she came up with an idea to keep Testing Notes for each issue within it. So when we implement the feature she usually fill in Testing Notes - how things should work, what to watch for, and so on. Sometimes we fill this info while testing, because not all goes this round trip.</p>
<p>I noticed that this helped me improve my testing skills. It makes me think about tests first and when I separate testing from preparing Testing Notes I get better at both.</p>
<p>I tried to follow sth like this before, on paper, by myself, but it didn&#8217;t last long. The addition of transparency (the whole teams see Testing Notes) made me commit to it which is great.</p>
