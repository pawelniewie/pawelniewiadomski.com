<blockquote>
<p>Well, things as always are complicated and simple at the same time</p>
<p>An idea is not only one unknown variable. I guess it is not as important as other variables. To the equation you have to add some at last 4 more unknown variables: time, place, targeted marketing strategy, people=team, despite of optimized UX of your solution. You&#8217;ve probably know that. I guess it&#8217;s hard to build one project and hit your dream goal. Solving 5 unknown variables equation can be simple for more and more experienced people at least you can appropriatelyÂ push your dreams forward.</p>
<p>Good luck with your dreams and finding right people.</p>

<p>Thanks <a href="http://pl.linkedin.com/pub/piotr-maruszak/4/a80/a00">Piotr</a> for sharing. I totally agree that there&#8217;s a plenty of variables involved and building a product and a team can be really challenging.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently reading couple of books that help sort out those variables (Lean Startup, The Entrepreneur&#8217;s Guide to Customer Development and The Startup&#8217;s Owner Manual) but it&#8217;s still challenging. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s great to have people around that are familiar with different areas.</p>
<p>No need to have them as co-founders but it&#8217;s great to have an ability to talk with somebody. Sometimes different perspective brings a lot of value. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m also always happy to provide feedback to others.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re absolutely right that it&#8217;s also a matter of experience. You&#8217;re here for the long run, so if you continue and push yourself forward you can achieve a lot of amazing things!</p>
<p>I learned one thing - you don&#8217;t have to rush things, as I sometimes do, everything will work out in the end.</p>
