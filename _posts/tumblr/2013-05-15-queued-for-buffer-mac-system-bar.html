<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_mmuypljxD01s8nah1o1_500.png"/><br/><p>I&#8217;m happy to announce you can now download <a href="http://queuedupdates.appspot.com/binaries/Queued-0.4.zip">Queued 0.2</a> which brings new features:</p>
<ul><li>you can easily delete wrong pending updates</li>
<li>you can refresh your queues manually (just in case 30 seconds is too long for you)</li>
<li>icon is now black, unless you have all queues full then it will be green (previously was red which was annoying)</li>
</ul><p><strong>What a n00b - I&#8217;ve uploaded an image with empty queues. Not a greates presentation of Queued :-)</strong></p>
