<p>I&#8217;ve recently crash landed from my bike breaking my left clavicle. It&#8217;s still fixing itself and I&#8217;m in plaster. So I have a lot of time to think. Unfortunately writing doesn&#8217;t come as easy as that. I wondered for days if it taught me anything.</p>

<p><strong>Leave a margin for an error</strong></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t and that&#8217;s why I crashed. I was speeding downhill. I was locked in my SPD shoes, I had a bus coming after me. I&#8217;m so fucking lucky that it was only a clavicle that I broke.</p>

<p>Even if everything goes fine and you&#8217;re happy living your life it can change in a fraction of time. So leave a buffer here and there to make the fall safe.</p>

<p><strong>SPD shoes</strong> are great for races but you shouldn&#8217;t use them in the city. I had too many problems because of them. I&#8217;m switching back to regular pedals.</p>

<p><strong>Wear a fucking helmet</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care if you look stupid, feel hot or whatever. Your life may end up in a second if you don&#8217;t have it in this right second. Just wear the damn thing.Â </p>

<p>Of course you&#8217;re better than me and you&#8217;ll never crash. I thought so too. That&#8217;s a known psychological flaw we all human have - attribution error (in short everyone thinks he&#8217;s better than others). Great that my wife forced me to wear it each time until it became a habit :-)</p>

<p><strong>You can bounce of from anything</strong></p>
<p>Unless you die you can survive a lot of pain. And usually the pain you imagine is worst that the actual one. The idea of breaking a bone scared me so much. Now I know it&#8217;s not that bad, our body is great at recovering. It can heal quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Eating well is very important</strong></p>
<p>I eat really healthy and that helps me recover. The food you put into your body not only nourishes you but affects your mood, stress response, healing, satisfaction, sex drive and a lot more.</p>

<p>By eating good stuff you&#8217;re more prepared for anything that can happen to you.</p>

<p><strong>Polish healthcare is so fucked up</strong></p>
<p>A guy with a broken bone has no chance to see orthopedist in a reasonable time (you should go and verify bone alignment after a few days from the accident) unless he pays and goes to a private practitioner or spends half a day in queue waiting to be exceptionally admitted.</p>

<p>I always knew that it&#8217;s bad with public healthcare here but didn&#8217;t expect it to be so bad. The whole system is unbelievably broken.</p>

<p><strong>Polish national healthcare insurance</strong></p>
<p>The mandatory government insurance provider will bring out any mistake you made before giving you money - I&#8217;ve missed one payment in 2012/09 and now I&#8217;m summoned to explain myself and write an official statement which I already did 6 months ago, but seems they&#8217;ve missed that.</p>

<p>Awesome!</p>
