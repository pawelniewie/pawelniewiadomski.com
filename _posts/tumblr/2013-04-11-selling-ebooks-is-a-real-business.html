<p>Or as people like to call informational products, which they are.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently had a pleasure to be a part of <a href="http://unicornfree.com" target="_blank">Amy Hoy</a>'s roundtable on launching products. It was mostly about informational products.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always loathed at writing and selling ebooks online. Couple of reasons here: I&#8217;m not the guy buying stuff from a random folks, I found many cheesy sites trying to sell you shit, I didn&#8217;t know anyone buys them and I always was able to find what I was looking after.</p>
<p>I knew of some successful people writing ebooks like <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/" target="_blank">Chris Guillebeau</a> or Amy, or <a href="http://www.fatburningman.com/">James Abel</a>. But it didn&#8217;t occur to me that I could do it.</p>
<p>I still can&#8217;t but I see now there are other folks almost like me doing this stuff. The panel speakers were <a href="https://twitter.com/grmpyprogrammer" target="_blank">Brennan Dunn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/brandonsavage" target="_blank">Brandon Savage</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/grmpyprogrammer" target="_blank">Chris Hartjes</a> - new comers to the market with their first publications.</p>
<p>They all were able to earn around 30k$ (in sum) withing five weeks of their launch (ebook release).</p>
<p>What was their success:</p>
<ul><li>I think first and foremost they had already built a reputation (or were building it during writing of their ebooks)</li>
<li>they all focused on building a good product that addressed needs</li>
<li>they listened to their friends and readers - their books were created as a reaction to queries they received</li>
<li>they shared their story, thanks to that gathered readers and friends</li>
<li>they progressively attracted people and before they really launched their ebooks they had already list of people wanting to buy it</li>
</ul><p>Simple as that. But not so simple. It&#8217;s nothing you can repeat in a few weeks. Unless I don&#8217;t know sth about it?</p>
<p>Requires hard work and focus - they all focused (mostly) on one topic, one platform, etc.</p>
<p>As I recently started blogging I&#8217;m still having a problem with identifying myself here - I write about many things. Sometimes unrelated. The general topic is whatever I find worth sharing.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m not sure how I could use their strategy to create an informational product. But it&#8217;s great knowing that it&#8217;s a valid option to earn money.</p>
