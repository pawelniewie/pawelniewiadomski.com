<p>I sometimes need to finish when I&#8217;m half way done. I usually left a note in the code for me (or on the desk), but what I find works best is writing a simple unit test that will remind you tomorrow.</p>
<p>You are already writing your tests for the code, right? So why not to add a reminder there. <span> </span><span>It&#8217;s five minutes work</span><span> :-)</span></p>
