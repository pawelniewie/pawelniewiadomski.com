<p>My wife just told me she&#8217;s scared by how many things she picked up from me - she was talking about doing searches for different staff and picking the first right one.</p>
<p>You know how usually women do shopping and why we men hate participating in it - they go from one shop to another even if they already know that the &#8220;dream come true&#8221; shoes were in the first shop.</p>
<p>Because you never know what&#8217;s behind the corner. And it would be great but usually even when they return to the shop and buy those damn shoes they keep thinking about other possibilities.</p>
<p>We all do that from time to time. It&#8217;s based in human psychology and the bigger the stake the harder it is to choose.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fine. But be awake and sometimes choose not to choose so you&#8217;ll save your time and actually make a better choice. Or at least don&#8217;t waste so much time and energy on it.</p>
<p>It goes other way around too - if you try to sell or offer anything to people help them choose by limiting options.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to decide which meal to order if you have 40 to choose from.</p>
