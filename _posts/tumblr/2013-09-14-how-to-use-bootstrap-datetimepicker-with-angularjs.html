<p>It&#8217;s an awesome component available for bootstrap. I really like how easy it is to use it from user perspective.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t so easy to integrate it with my angularjs app. First of all I use Bootstrap 3, so I had to find <a href="https://github.com/CuGBabyBeaR/bootstrap-datetimepicker.git" target="_blank">a version that works with it</a> (the original supports 2 only).</p>
<p>I found <a href="http://mgcrea.github.io/angular-strap/" target="_blank">AngularStrap</a> which is an extension brining a lot of bootstrap based components to <span>AngularJS. Unfortunately there wasn&#8217;t any for datetimepicker, but </span>there was one for datepicker. It was a good starting point. Without it I wouldn&#8217;t even consider starting this on my own.</p>
<p>Couple hours later I had a working example with markup (see the picture above, it&#8217;s in HAML an awesome markup language for Ruby).</p>
<p>The only missing piece was to figure out how to make this datetimepicker actually return correct date (the bloody bastard was breaking all dates due to time zone offset).</p>
<p>Luckily <a href="https://github.com/smalot/bootstrap-datetimepicker/issues/122" target="_blank">OlivierB shared his workaround for this issue</a> which I incorporated into my angular-datetimepicker.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I call social programming ;-)</p>
