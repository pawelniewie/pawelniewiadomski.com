<p>I just received e-mail from Evernote saying they are going on with their API rate limits. Twitter enabled API rate limits recently causing a lot of connection to fail or vanish because they weren&#8217;t able to cope with the limits.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be a better idea to actually charge for API access?</p>
<p>If you really want to have the ecosystem under control, why don&#8217;t you just ask developers to pay for using the service?</p>
<p>This way if they are successful you&#8217;re successful too.</p>
<p>Better idea than to just punish everyone for using your API.</p>
