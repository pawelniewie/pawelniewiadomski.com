<p>Today&#8217;s topic was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937557022/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1937557022&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pawelniewia-20%22&gt;Mobile%20First&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img%20src=%22http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pawelniewia-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1937557022">Mobile First</a> book by Luke Wroblewski.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul><li>design always in context of the end user</li>
<li>don&#8217;t think about using the same engine to run both desktop and mobile versions</li>
<li>Android developers have hard time doing regular things like swipes</li>
<li>responsive pages may seem like a cheaper to build but usually aren&#8217;t</li>
<li>no good tools to test responsive pages</li>
<li>tablet, phone and desktop</li>
<li>people don&#8217;t like HTML5 apps dressed as native apps</li>
<li>frustrated users shake their phones, great idea is to ask them for feedback then</li>
<li>don&#8217;t try to force everything into your app</li>
<li>lean first, mobile then</li>
<li>ads may not work on mobile as they used too on the desktop</li>
<li>people trust Apple, they trust in App Store</li>
<li>Poland is still way back vs US in case of mobile awareness and usage</li>
<li>not many people buy stuff (from ecommerce sites) via phones in Poland</li>
