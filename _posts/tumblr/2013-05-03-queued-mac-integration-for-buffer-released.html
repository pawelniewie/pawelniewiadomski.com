Just released my MVP for <a href="http://queuedupdates.appspot.com/binaries/Queued-0.4.zip">Queued</a> a nice addition to <a href="http://bufferapp.com" target="_blank">Buffer</a>.</p>
<p>Your Buffer queue is now a click away. No need to check your email to see notifications from Buffer, or use your browser to see what you have already scheduled.</p>
<p>Currently you can see all your pending updates for each profile (updated every 30 seconds).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s great - you can also reorder scheduled updates by dragging them. You can reorder items only within one profile (something that will be solved in the future).</p>
<p>If you schedule enough posts to keep Buffer happy the icon will turn green!</p>
<p>Coming soon - ability to remove scheduled posts, refresh button, anything more you need?</p>
<p>Right click on the icon to send me feedback (or check for updates).</p>
