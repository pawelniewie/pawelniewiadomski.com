<p>I wanted to share a lesson I learned recently while working on Atlassian JIRA. The big feature that we&#8217;re working on is ability to rename users.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll be able to change a username and it will work, the user will still have the same permissions, all references to it will be kept and world will not fall apart.</p>

<p>You&#8217;d think that it should be a no brainer and why I&#8217;m even talking about it.</p>

<p>But if you&#8217;ve ever seen JIRA massive API you&#8217;d notice one thing. Each username (class User) is referenced everywhere by it&#8217;s name.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s the lesson I learned. Someone many years ago decided that we have this User (class) but it&#8217;s unique key is username (BTW it had also id, but username is so more developer friendly) so let&#8217;s not force developers to pass User everywhere, let&#8217;s simplify, decrease memory consumption, make things a nanosecond faster and use username everywhere in each API method.</p>

<p>And they did. Everywhere - low level or high level APIs were using username instead of this User class. And the API grew by those years.</p>

<p>So lesson learned, if you have some model objects that are basic for your system like - User, Group, Project, etc. you should never optimize the API to take only a part of it. I know you want to be smart, you want to optimize and the username is so unique that it will never change.</p>

<p>But remember about folks using this software 10 years from now (yup) they may want to change the uniqueness constraint. Make our job easier. Thanks in advance! :-)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m saying you should be thinking about future cases and trying to predict them. Further from true, I&#8217;m saying that you should create interfaces that are light and easy to refactor. In this case taking out a single property out of User and making it dominant violates this.</p>
