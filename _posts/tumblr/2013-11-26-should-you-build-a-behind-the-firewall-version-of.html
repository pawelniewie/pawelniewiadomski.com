<p>I&#8217;m building <a href="http://teamstatus.tv">TeamStatus.TV</a>Â - an awesome way to visualize your projects.</p>
<p>One of the questions when building a software you must answer yourself - cloud or BTF?</p>
<p>I thought I&#8217;m going to go as long as possible with cloud only and then do BTF when I have enough customers. But funny to mention - one of my earliest customers (a friend at the company) needs BTF version!</p>
<p>If he decided to go with cloud version his experience would have been crippled - because some of the sources are BTF and not accessible outside of the company.</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s going to be part of my unique selling proposition :-)</p>
