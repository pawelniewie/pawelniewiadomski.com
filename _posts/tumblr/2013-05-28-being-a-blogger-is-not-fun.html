<p>Oh, my gosh, I&#8217;ve just learned <a href="http://liveyourlegend.net/the-3-step-formula-i-used-to-get-4000-subscribers-in-12-months-the-last-web-traffic-guide-youll-ever-need/" target="_blank">how hard it is to run a blog</a>. Not only you need to be a fucking genius writer but an awesome socializer. And that&#8217;s for a start. Then you need to put enormous amount of work and time to reach people.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever though about running a blog (a successful blog) please go and read this stuff. It&#8217;s crucial you understand it because AFAIK each of the successful bloggers operates like that.</p>
<p>For me it&#8217;s so unimaginable - me talking to strange people, trying to promote myself on the web and having many social interactions?</p>
<p>Forget about it. Better go and check in at dungeon ;-)</p>
