Not only he did that but in the meantime he run his business, published to best selling books (both of them I read and strongly recommend), kept a blog and inspired hundreds of people. That a great man.</span></p>
<p>Chase Jarvis - is a creative soule, a photographer, a director, a businessman which also runs a series of meetings with other inspiring people.</p>
<p>Both of them I&#8217;ve known for a long time, they are my mentors so these meeting couldn&#8217;t go unnoticed - they&#8217;ve sat and talked recently,</p>
<p><span>It was a blast, so I propose you to watch them. I believe you&#8217;ll get plenty out of it, you&#8217;ll be inspired to say least :-)</span></p>
