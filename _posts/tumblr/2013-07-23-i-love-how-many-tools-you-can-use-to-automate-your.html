<p>Today I played around with AppleScript for the first time. Imagine it was started 20 years ago!</p>
<p>I wanted to create icon set for <a href="http://pawelniewiadomski.com/queued">Queued</a>. That&#8217;s a repetitive task that I&#8217;m going to do when I iterate over the design and look of the icon so I should automate it!</p>
<p>Unfortunately Automator had a bad day (using developer preview version) so why not to try out AppleScript?</p>
<p>I like it&#8217;s &#8220;englisheness&#8221;, I see they tried to make it sound like a real language which I think is good for newcomers. Few minutes with Google gave me a good starting point (well, let&#8217;s be honest - almost everything).</p>
<p>You can get the final result from my <a href="https://github.com/pawelniewie/mac-automation">mac automation</a> repository which I&#8217;ve just created. That was a good trigger to put it there.</p>
<p>The script will ask you for a file and a destination folder and will create files 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128 and 256x256. You can easily tweak it to produce other sizes.</p>
