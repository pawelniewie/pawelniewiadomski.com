<p>Now each team has their own wallboard based on AtlasBoard, I wonder why we haven&#8217;t yet had a contest for the best wallboard? ;-)</p>
<p>In our room we have a big TV that presents the latest builds, metrics and other gadgetry so we look like we&#8217;re busy all the time.</p>
<p>With a few simple steps you can create a wallboard for your team.</p>
