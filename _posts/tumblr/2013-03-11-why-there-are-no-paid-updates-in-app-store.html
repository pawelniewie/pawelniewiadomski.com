<p>Why there are no paid updates in App Store</p>
<p>Software as a service usually means a server somewhere maintained by a company that allows you to do the job. Let it be wasting online time (like Facebook) or managing tasks (like Trello).</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not all. Ever wondered why Apple doesn&#8217;t give developers any way to charge for upgrades? I was stumbled by this and I was thinking why those smart people from Apple didn&#8217;t think about such a crucial thing?</p>

<p>And believe me that&#8217;s a crucial thing - after you establish relationship with your software customers you really want to charge them again. Software development costs and producing and releasing a new version costs. So having customers paying for updates from time to time is crucial.</p>

<p>This model is executed flawlessly by smart folks at Atlassian that will charge you every year for an ongoing relationship/maintenance.</p>

<p>So, why Apple didn&#8217;t allow developers to do the same? If you&#8217;ve ever been interested in software development for Mac/iOS you probably noticed angry folks arguing that Apple should allow them to charge customers for updates.</p>

<p>Guess what, I think Apple is smarter than us. And I learned this recently. I think they want to introduce a new model of selling software - Software as a Service.</p>

<p>I see that some folks selling apps already learned this too. You should charge customers for additional features and ongoing use.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s so many options for In-App Purchase.</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s good for developers too. Ever wondered creating your application which are the most useful features, where&#8217;s the core of your product.</p>

<p>Now you can know for sure just ask customers to pay for some features and they&#8217;ll vote with their money. So you&#8217;ll know for sure what&#8217;s important for them.</p>
