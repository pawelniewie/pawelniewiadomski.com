<p>You could argue I should start with marketing first but in this case that&#8217;s something I need for my other product (<a href="http://pawelniewiadomski.com/queued">Queued</a>) so I had to create it nonetheless. But since I built it it would be great to have other people use it too.</p>
<p>So what should I do?</p>
<p>First of all, I&#8217;m going to add some tracking to see what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>Then I&#8217;m going to add some pricing as I want to charge for it.</p>
<p>Then I&#8217;m going to run small AdWords campaigns and observe what&#8217;s going on, do users find the message appealing? A/B test a few variants.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking it could be a good starting point for a site helping developers run beta programs for their upcoming apps. At least that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m interested in currently.</p>
