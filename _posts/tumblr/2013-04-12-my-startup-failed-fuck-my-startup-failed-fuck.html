<p><span>I finally said it, my startup failed. Fuck. I felt like I was coming out of the closet when I first stated it aloud to my co-founder. We both knew for months it was not working out, but we never explicitly defined our situation as a failed one. Now that the elephant in the room has a name, we’ll&#8230;</span></p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard admitting failure to yourself. It was hard for me too. Each time I always pushed myself too far knowing the obvious. Now I tend to ask my wife, women usually see those things better.</p>
<p>I think my current approach is fail it fast, re-bounce fast, there&#8217;s so many ideas to try. And have fun all the way. If you don&#8217;t have the fun don&#8217;t do it. Because the fun may be actually the only prize you get for trying.</p>
