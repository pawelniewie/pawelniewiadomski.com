<p>For this ShipIt I wanted to investigate how to ease life of our users by allowing them not to have to remember yet another username/password to access JIRA.</p>

<p>Because LinkedIn is the worlds biggest professional network I decided to go and use them to authenticate users for JIRA. They give nice JavaScript Sign In button with allows you to setup whole authentication in minutes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that requires a fixed domain name and cross origin headers. Nothing wrong with that but I wanted to make it a plugin that everyone could install (so no prior knowledge of domain name). Decided to use some Java client library.</p>
<p>A bit of JavaScript injecting a button on log in page.</p>

<p><span>Redirects you to LinkedIn as part of OAuth dance.</span></p>

<p><span>A new fresh account is created for you (if it doesn&#8217;t exist) and you&#8217;re automatically logged in.</span></p>

<p><span>Some nice defaults.</span></p>

<p><span>Since we now have a user and his OAuth tokens we can do whatever we want (as long as he agrees) - get details from LinkedIn about his connections, publish some updates like new releases, promote issues (like spreading the world to reach more voters), etc.</span></p>
