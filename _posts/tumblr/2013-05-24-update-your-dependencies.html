<p>I was going to start this post with a story how JIRA used Velocity 1.4 long after it was dead twice. Not to mention other old and crappy libraries. But having old Velocity was special PITA because I was creating a plugin writing most of HTML in Velocity with a lot of components that should be easily shared between templates and I wasn&#8217;t able to use macros and share them across all of the templates.</p>
<p>We could investigate and spent time choosing different template engine but because we had already so much templates in Velocity which we were going to update/refresh only we haven&#8217;t made that decision. Probably from a time perspective knowing that the project grew in scope and time we could have made that switch at the start. But who would know?</p>
<p>But that actually made me think about broader issue that actually led to this state - being too much focused on providing the value, and being obsessed on direct return on investment. One of sins that many companies do.</p>
<p>We tell ourselves &#8220;if it works doesn&#8217;t touch it&#8221;, &#8220;good is enough&#8221;, and so on. We tell ourselves we always need to bring a value to the customer (XP) and so on. And a bunch of other &#8220;mottos&#8221; that lead to the state in which you don&#8217;t do anything that doesn&#8217;t provide direct ROI.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a trap. Because if you miss the train it can be too late. Like for example a commercial product using an obsolete, unmaintained by anyone framework, or a library that has a lot of bugs that are solved already in a newer versions but because it would be too much time and risk to upgrade you&#8217;re stuck.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easier to upgrade stuff bit by bit at the start of each iteration (just to let it soke in). This way if you&#8217;re going to run a big and long running project you actually avoid risk of staying in the back.</p>
<p>By spending now you actually save yourself from big spending in the future. Treat it as insurance.</p>
<p>Go update your dependencies. Don&#8217;t let them rot.</p>
