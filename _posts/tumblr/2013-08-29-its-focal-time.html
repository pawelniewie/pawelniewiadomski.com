<p>It&#8217;s that time of the year! Our beloved self-assesment is here and it&#8217;s time to review yourself and your peers!</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s an inevitable part of running a larger company. We had them at Intel, we have them at Atlassian too. I hate them with my guts.</p>
<p>But this year, I hate them less. Am I becoming a corporate drone?</p>
<p>In previous times I did some cocky one line reviews, but now I did almost an elaborate ;-)</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on?</p>
<p>I think I approached it differently - first of all keeping a diary helped me to remember what actually happened in the past 12 months. Also I realized that because of our distributed nature (my manager is in Sydney and his manager too) it&#8217;s a rare chance for us to talk about my performance.</p>
<p>I also treated it as a way to highlight things that I learned and my plans for the future.</p>
<p>I wish I didn&#8217;t have to write it. I wish we had a great contact, I wish we talked about performance, plans and mistakes as part of the job. But that&#8217;s never the part of the job, we&#8217;re too busy to do that nowadays.</p>
<p>I always preach direct communication and honesty, I don&#8217;t have problem with that, but I imagine in a large company it may be really hard for some people to talk about their failures or point them out in the work of others.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;d run a company I&#8217;d not run reviews, they&#8217;re waste of time, instead I&#8217;d run a mentoring program in the spirit of trust and cooperation for your personal benefit. Because I&#8217;d want each employee to grow.</p>
