<p>Last weekend I&#8217;ve completed my quarterly 1:1 with myself on my goals progress. It was great. I realized how much I progressed in the past months.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started my <a href="http://alexhillman.com/defrag-your-brain-with-a-sparkfile" target="_blank">sparkle file</a> that fosters my creativity.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started writing stuff in my diary.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve sold a few licenses for <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.pawelniewiadomski.devs.jira.automat" target="_blank">my JIRA plugin</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve released my <a href="http://pawelniewiadomski.pl/2013/05/03/queued-mac-integration-for-buffer-released.html" target="_blank">first Mac software</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned a lot about differences between introverts and extroverts which helped me understand my wife (need to write about it).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve stared re-learing French.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve discovered how easy it is to <a href="http://tinyhabits.com" target="_blank">set up new habits</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written down my personal goals and almost instantly I&#8217;ve achieved some of them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve deadlifted and squatted 120&#160;kg.</p>
<p>It was first time when I actually did a retrospective. It hit me that it was not a spectacular quarter. Sure it was great, but the previous ones were great too. But by not writing down and by not really thinking about my accomplishments they went unnoticed.</p>
<p>If you asked me a year ago if I made any accomplishments it would be hard for me to list them. But since I keep a diary, I focus my time not only on actions but also on retrospectives and thinking it was easier for me to notice all those little things that actually pushed me forward.</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s great is that noticing progress makes you really want to achieve more and believe that anything is in your reach. At least in mine :-)</p>
