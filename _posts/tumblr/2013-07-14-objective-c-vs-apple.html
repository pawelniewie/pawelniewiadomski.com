<p>I was just watching WWDC 2013 videos when it hit me. Apple&#8217;s been doing a great job improving Objective-C. Each conference they announce a set of new great features.</p>
<p>On one hand Objective-C seems like a mammoth from the early times, something that&#8217;s so obsolete, strange and totally against current trends (C? who wants to use C? no garbage collector? etc.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, knowing it you can start loving it. I&#8217;m already past the stage when it all looked strange. I now appreciate the beauty of the language and tools around it. Sure they still lack in some aspects, but in others they are ahead.</p>
<p>So, watching this videos one thing stroked me - Apple&#8217;s being the only one using the language they have a freedom to shape it however they like it.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re using C or C++ you need to stick to the standard, if you&#8217;re on Java you have the same. And influencing standards that are so widely used is not a trivial thing. They don&#8217;t need to consult anyone, heck there&#8217;s even no &#8220;real&#8221; specification of the language itself.</p>
<p>I envy them their possibilities to shape their tools :-)</p>
