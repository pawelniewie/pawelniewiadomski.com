<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_msi5rarGkV1s8nah1o1_1280.png"/><br/><p>Yesterday is started working on a small website for publishing and managing updates for Sparkle (AKA appcasts).</p>
<p>I guess I want to automate my workflow a bit for <a href="http://pawelniewiadomski.com/queued">Queued</a>. I&#8217;m currently using Google App Engine to host my updates, but the whole workflow is cumbersome - need to prepare the app file, write down details about the version (build no and version), update the file and upload it.</p>
<p>I wish I could do this with one command. I want to build the app and send it somewhere and be done with it.</p>
<p>So with a little help of ruby, sinatra, bootstrap, amazon web services and heroku <a href="http://appcasts.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">this idea is getting real</a>.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m going to do to simplify the process?</p>
<ul><li>I&#8217;m going to publish Sparkle framework that will be customized for the site (source code will be available at <a href="https://github.com/pawelniewie/Sparkle" target="_blank">github</a>)</li>
<li>I&#8217;m going to write a command line app to will allow easy uploads to the site</li>
<li>I&#8217;m going to give a nice endpoint for downloading the latest version (so you can use it on your product site)</li>
<li>I&#8217;m going to give you some stats</li>
</ul><p>Interested? <a href="http://appcasts.herokuapp.com">Go and log in!</a> It doesn&#8217;t work now, but you&#8217;ll be remembered and notified about updates :-)</p>
<p>In the end you&#8217;ll be able to run an appcast in less that 5 minutes!</p>
