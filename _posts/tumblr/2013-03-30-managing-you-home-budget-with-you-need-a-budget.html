<p><strong>Update:</strong> moved the script to <a href="https://github.com/pawelniewie/bankster">GitHub</a></p>
<p>Bad news for me. It seems two years ago I haven&#8217;t paid one of the taxes and now I owe 900 PLN. We&#8217;ve spent 1000 PLN more on groceries this month. Those <strike>delicious</strike> damn nuts are expensive. No month is the same even if you plan for it. And accidents happen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a little bit stressed because I had plans and now I need to change them. But at least I know I had plans and I know what I need to change. This time I&#8217;m smarter.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t so well prepared before. Before I properly budgeted my money I was just running a month to a month and just living by. When something big happened (like car insurance, or yearly taxes) I was scared, stressed and unprepared.</p>
<p>But since I started using <a href="http://youneedabudget.com" target="_blank">YNAB</a> properly I have buffers I can use for situations like this. If you happen to feel your money sometimes goes out of control try then some budgeting. I bet it will help.</p>
<p>What I found using YNAB is that it&#8217;s not worth to be too picky about categories. I&#8217;ve started with 40 or 50 categories and tried to track each expense groups separately (like kids fun, cosmetics, PIT, VAT, etc.). Now I&#8217;m using around 30 or 35 (including business). But daily spendings are mostly associated with 3-5 categories. Other categories are funds we are gathering for different purposes.</p>
<p>I could go by with even less categories, but I haven&#8217;t yet made my mind.</p>
<p>So what we track separately?</p>
<p>As they suggest I have grouped categories in following groups: Daily spendings, Funds for hard times, Monthly, Business, Savings.</p>
<p>Daily spendings includes: Groceries and rest, Gas, Nanny, Fun, Sport</p>
<p>Funds for hard times: Doctor, Cash flow buffer, Car repairs, Home stuff, Car insurance, Gifts, Christmas (yes, we prepare for it from January)</p>
<p>Monthly:  Mortgage, Electricity, Phones+Net, Home rent</p>
<p>Business: Net visibility (servers, domans, etc.), Taxes, New phone, New computer, Software, Education</p>
<p>Savings: Holidays, Car replacement, Retirement, New photo camera</p>
<p>I could combine monthly expenses into one because they are usually the same and maybe I will. But for now I haven&#8217;t decided to do it.</p>
<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking that&#8217;s a lot of stuff to track expenses against, right?</p>
<p>But by paying with a card I have automated most of it - <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pawelniewiadomski/bankster">I wrote a simple app</a> that takes my statements from mBank and Eurobank which I use and automatically puts them into You Need a Budget!</p>
<p>So I need to worry about entering only a few items per month and YNAB iPhone app helps me with that.</p>
<p>This way I have full visibility of my expenses and also what&#8217;s great is I prepare 3 months in advance.</p>
<p>Knowing my usual per day income I estimate what would be my income for following months. Then I can decide what to do why my money.</p>
<p>And this is where the fun begins! When you know all of this you can start planning and saving for stuff you want! And then you can react knowingly.</p>
<p>Hope you&#8217;ll get a look on YNAB which is great. If you have any questions feel free to ping me.</p>
