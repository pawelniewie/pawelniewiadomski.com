<p>Our office got new guests and they are real personas ;-)</p>
<p>Defining personas for your project is one of the greatest thing you can do to understand your users. We haven&#8217;t been using it until recently (like a year or two) but I love it.</p>
<p>Having a &#8220;psychological&#8221; scope of the user is great ;-) Usually personas are generalized, segmented description of major users for the system.</p>
<p>We talk about their needs, likes, fears, and habits to help us understand how to make the software usable for all of them.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never tried it before your should definitively spend some time with your PM and team to understand you users.Â </p>
<p>Go and meet your personas!</p>
