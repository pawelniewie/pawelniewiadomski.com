<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_mkkntnND0w1s8nah1o1_1280.png"/><br/><p>I started with an idea of creating a new Twitter client that would satisfy my needs. I love tweeting using TweetDeck. It has a multi-column layout, keyboards navigation, it&#8217;s really nice. But it lacks a big feature - there&#8217;s no <a href="http://bufferapp.com" target="_blank">buffer</a> integration. Also it&#8217;s not lists focused and has some usability glitches. So I decided to make a better version. But that&#8217;s a long way. So I had to split the whole project.</p>
<p>Finally I can ship first version of &lt;a href=&#8221;http://hoopoeapplcom&#8221;&gt;Hoopoe App&lt;/a&gt;. It has still long way until it reaches my dream but I&#8217;ve settled the first stone.</p>
<p>I made public my little <a href="https://github.com/pawelniewie/buffered">SDK for Buffer</a> that will let you use this service in your Mac app easily. I attached a nice example that let&#8217;s you change order of your posts in queue for each profile. Just drag and drop and changes will instantly go to the server.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still under development so expect new features to be added.Â </p>
