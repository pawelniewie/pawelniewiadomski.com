The last thing I want to mention is how to make a call to BitBucket REST API from the server. This is something I struggled for. Seems the official documentation hasn't been updated and you need to figure it out on your own.

{% include series.html %}

As the user already allowed the plugin to access his account it doesn't make sense to do an additional OAuth dance. So [BitBucket Cloud OAuth](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/concepts/oauth2.html) supports a special JWT Grant that you can use from the add-on to get the access token. 

Here's how I get the access token:

```ruby
def get_access_token
  unless current_jwt_auth
    raise 'Missing Authentication context'
  end

  # Expiry for the JWT token is 3 minutes from now
  issued_at = Time.now.utc.to_i
  expires_at = issued_at + 180

  jwt = JWT.encode({
                       iat: issued_at,
                       exp: expires_at,
                       iss: current_jwt_auth.addon_key,
                       sub: current_jwt_auth.client_key
                   }, current_jwt_auth.shared_secret)

  response = HTTParty.post("#{current_jwt_auth.base_url}/site/oauth2/access_token", {
      body: {grant_type: 'urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt'},
      headers: {
          'Content-Type' => 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
          'Authorization' => 'JWT ' + jwt
      }
  })

  if response.code == 200
    Response.new(200, response.parsed_response)
  else
    Response.new(response.code)
  end
end
```

You don't need `qsh` here. You need to use `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, JSON is not allowed.

The returned token will not have a refresh token, to refresh it call `get_access_token` again with JWT token.

Once you get the access token you can call BitBucket REST API with `Authorization: Bearer token` as you would normally do with any OAuth 2.0 service.

I hope you enjoyed the tutorial. If you have any questions feel free to [contact me](https://twitter.com/devonsteroids).
