I had a great time in Sofia attending EuRuKo! We had great hosts as part of AirHelp's team is located there! It was a good chance to unite, drink some rakija and talk about coding.

If you weren't lucky to attend here's my subjective list of the best presentations.

You can grab [all videos from the conference](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChGs1td4ViQFqT0jlvkyUJg?utm_source=rubyweekly&utm_medium=email) as a playlist too.
