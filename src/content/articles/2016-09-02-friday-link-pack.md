I love Active Record for its flexibility. [Advanced SQL in Rails](http://brewhouse.io/2016/08/04/sql-in-rails.html) shows you how to use views and window functions.

Good software starts with a good design. Here's an interesting example of good design in real life - [australian pedestrian button](http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/dr-karl-need-to-know/2016/08/the-pedestrian-button/). I used it many times. Now I know how much thought was put into it!

Using [machine learning](https://github.com/arielf/weight-loss) to manage weight! Awesome real life hack. I wasn't surprised with results thought. I'm an avid [Authority Nutrition](http://authoritynutrition.com) reader and I know how to eat healthy - fats are your friend not the enemy!

I used to write apps for iOS and Mac so this report got my full attention - [Selling on the App Store VS Building Your Own Theme Park](http://devmate.com/mac-dev-survey). Great insight into the market and distribution channels.

[Airbnb: The Growth Story You Didn't Know](https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/airbnb) - great story on bootstrapping your company. Selling breakfast cereal and other craziness. This is pure drive in life!

Ever wanted to have a database per branch in your Rails projects? [Branchinator](https://github.com/pawelniewie/branchinator) helps you with that.
