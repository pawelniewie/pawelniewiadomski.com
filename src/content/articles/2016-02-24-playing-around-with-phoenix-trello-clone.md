I was playing recently with [Phoenix Trello](https://github.com/bigardone/phoenix-trello) an open source clone of Trello.

I'm looking for ways to add new features to Zen as quickly as possible and with the least effort I can. So when I found it I though it would be great to incorporate it.

But since I played with it I'm not so eager. I decided that boards in Trello-way would be a limitation.

I also want to focus first on more important things - like having a workflow and custom fields. I think I can achieve more having a simple issue view first.

Still thinking though. I know people love boards. But I don't want Zen to be another fancy board.

I'm more into process management.

Having said that I need to put the project aside for some time as I need to release [OpenID Authentication for ServiceDesk](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?q=openid) first. This is something that could potentially bring me more income.

And as I already did some fun stuff I'm going to present couple of brown bags at Spartez, this Friday is Ansible, then PostgREST, later React.
