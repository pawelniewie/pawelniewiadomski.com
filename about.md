Hi,
I'm Pawel Niewiadomski, [a software developer](http://linkedin.com/in/pawelniewiadomski/).

I was lucky to work as a contractor for Atlassian for over 7 years. During that time I learned how to create awesome products people love to use, how to support them and how to evolve them. I also witnessed how technology debt can accumulate over time and helped fight it.

I admire Atlassian for building a consistent set of tools that integrate heavily with each other making the sum much larger than each product alone.

That's why I'm also a big fan of Apple and part time Mac developer.

I do contract work from time to time.
