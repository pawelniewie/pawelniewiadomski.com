Imagine you have an ordered collection of rows in your database and want to get a row before the one you have or the next row after the one you have.

Lets say we have some `InitineraryFlights` in the app and we want to 
Lets say that the position is driven by a field called `position`.

In SQL you use window functions for that. If you don't know them yet - [read this article](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/postgres-window-functions) for a beginning.



```ruby
scope :with_previous_and_next_flights, -> (itinerary_id) { from_previous_next_flights(itinerary_id) }
```

```ruby
def self.from_previous_next_flights(itinerary_id)
    from <<-SQL.strip_heredoc
      (select *, lag(id) over(order by position) as prev, lead(id) over(order by position) as next from itinerary_flights where itinerary_id=#{itinerary_id.to_i}) AS itinerary_flights
    SQL
end
```

```ruby
previous_flight = ItineraryFlight.with_previous_and_next_flights(itinerary_flight.itinerary_id).where('next = ?', itinerary_flight.id).first
```

```ruby
next_flight = ItineraryFlight.with_previous_and_next_flights(itinerary_flight.itinerary_id).where('prev = ?', itinerary_flight.id).first
```
