I totally understand that you want to create a robust and beautiful code that has 100% code coverage and is bug free ðŸ¦„

But years of software development thought me that it doesn't make sense most of the time. There's a great book on topic called [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X). I'm not saying you must read it, but you can if you want.

I'm sometimes misunderstood by less experienced developers, they focus too much on proving they are "senior", on playing with new shiny toys, with using the raddest and the latest, by making code so well designed that it can do x, y and z because it's so generic.

Here are two articles I found about over-enginnering that represent well what I have in mind.

[10 modern software engineering mistakes](https://medium.com/@rdsubhas/10-modern-software-engineering-mistakes-bc67fbef4fc8#.fv0fcd65u) is a good read about creating well designed apps and pitfalls you can run into preparing you code for everything (which eventually doesn't happen).

[How to accept over-engineering for what it really is](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-accept-over-engineering-for-what-it-really-is-6fca9a919263#.ptgn7n4uq) is another point of view.

As I often say it all depends. [Tests](https://pawelniewiadomski.com/2016/08/22/what-kind-of-tests-to-write-when-developing-software/) are one aspect, the code in general is another.
