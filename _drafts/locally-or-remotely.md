Hiring developers - locally or remotely?

So you're building a team of developers that will implement your awesome business idea. You already had some agency build your proof of concept, maybe you even got some funding. Now, you need to decide how you're going to structure your company - years ago the decision was simple - rent an office and they will come ;-)

Now, there's so many options - hire locally, create a distributed company, have some mix of both, hire freelancers, full time employees, start locally, go globally, etc. Here's my take on that.

I had a chance to work with people all around the world and in the same office. For many years I teamed up with people living in Sydney which was 7-10 hours away from Gdansk (depending on time).

What's good about having people in the same office?

I guess the most important thing is that you build better relationships faster.
