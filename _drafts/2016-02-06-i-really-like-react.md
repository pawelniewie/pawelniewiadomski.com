I was hesitant to learn React first time I heard about it. I think it was mostly driven by the fact that I enjoyed using Angular 1 and I didn't like JSX syntax. Initially I thought mixing HTML inside JavaScript was a bad idea. I really like Angular's approach of mixing JS into HTML which felt more natural to me.

But as time passed I recently decided to try out React. Friend of mine is a huge fan of React. I though I should try it out too.

I did a small project in it
