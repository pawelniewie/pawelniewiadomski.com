Fixtures are meant to represent a snapshot of the system

- global state

It's like global variables leaking from place to another. You don't want to have that in your code, why would you want to have it in your tests?

Adding new fixtures means you can potentially have unexpected consequences like breaking tests.

- slower

You humble yourself writing simple code that does only what it has to do. The same should be with tests - do only what you have to do to prepare the test environment. Most of the time it doesn't make sense to put additional models into the database only to revert them after test is done.

- discoverability

If you have a global fixture for all your tests you don't know instantly what data is actually used. That make is harder to discover what given tests depends on.

- time consuming

Finding a fixture that would match your test case scenario can be time consuming. You'd probably prefer adding a new ones just to make is simpler but that's a gamble - you can't predict what those new ones will break. You like to gamble don't you?

- feature/testing whole

This is actually where fixtures come handy - feature tests and 

- factories

Usually you expect a factory to create valid entries only, with many associations between models it can be really tricky. It's easier sometimes to copy an existing fixture, adapt it and be done with it.

- code bloat

Factories are additional code in your project.

- fixtures can help you debug the problem - if you use them also in development

- creating fixtures helps you prepare data for testing

- fixtures more and more - kind of muddying things - if something changes to the model (i.e. validations, extra column), thereâ€™s a lot of fixtures you need to change

- what often strikes me is that some codes who prefer fixtures kind of dismiss factories out of hand, and then they sometimes end up building a factory inside the spec
 
- factories - you can create dynamic values
